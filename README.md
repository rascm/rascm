#### Hello World!
---
I'm just a hobby programmer who does not speak english. I would be almost lost without a translator, so i avoid any communication if possible. If you find any problems with my codes, please report them in the appropriate place. I try to respond to all suggestions in a clear way. If i don't know the answer to something, i find it up on the Internet. I'll put the source in a comment to the code i've copied. I hope to bring joy to others with these creations. I recommend that you use the polyfill library if you are using one of these creations:

```html
<!-- Paste this above my code -->
<script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js"></script>
```
